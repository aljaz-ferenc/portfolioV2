      "The user can choose the number of words and the app will fetch random words from random-word-api.herokuapp.com. A timer starts running when the users starts typing. The input is constantly being checked and the game stops when every input letter is correct or the user makes a mistake. At this point the timer stops and the average speed is calculated.",
      "By building this app I learned about new hooks, conditional rendering based on state, using loading animations and React Portals."
